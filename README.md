# Mapping_Earthquakes

This is an interactive world map using JavaScript ES6, D3 library(contains the Lat/Long as well as the magnitude, and GeoJson (hosts geographical information), retrieved the API from Mapbox, and the Leaflet library to plot the data.
Creating Earthquake maps is an important data viz and can be applied to other global related stories. Understanding the global relationships are critical in todays global environment. For the purpose of this assignment, Iâ€™m working with plotting the tectonic plates location, and frequency of seismic activity. 
Codes -> CSS, JS, and index.html
